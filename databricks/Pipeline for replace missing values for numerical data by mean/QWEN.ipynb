    "You are an expert Python developer specializing in the Databricks environment. Your task is to create a complete Python script to be executed within a Databricks notebook. The script must perform the following operations:\n",
    "1.\tData Retrieval from SpaceX API:\n",
    "o\tInteract with the SpaceX v3 REST API (https://api.spacexdata.com/v3).\n",
    "o\tRetrieve data from one specific endpoint likely containing numerical data where missing values might occur: \n",
    "\tAll launches: https://api.spacexdata.com/v3/launches\n",
    "\t(Self-correction: While launches is common, /cores might be a better example for potential missing numericals like reuse_count, rtls_landings etc. Let's use /cores for a potentially more illustrative example, but keep /launches as an alternative)\n",
    "\tAlternative/Primary: All Cores: https://api.spacexdata.com/v3/cores\n",
    "o\tHandle potential errors during the API calls (e.g., timeouts, non-200 status codes).\n",
    "2.\tMissing Value Imputation (Mean):\n",
    "o\tPerform mean imputation on the retrieved data (list of dictionaries).\n",
    "o\tImputation Logic: \n",
    "\tIdentify Numerical Fields: First, automatically identify the keys/fields within the dictionaries that predominantly contain numerical values (int or float). You might need to inspect the first few records or a sample to determine these fields reliably, or iterate through all records checking types.\n",
    "\tCalculate Mean per Field: For each identified numerical field, calculate the mean using only the existing, non-missing (not None) numerical values across all records in the dataset.\n",
    "\tImpute Missing Values: Iterate through the dataset again. For each numerical field, replace any missing values (represented as None) with the pre-calculated mean for that specific field.\n",
    "\tHandle Edge Cases: If a numerical field contains only missing values (or no valid numbers to calculate a mean), log a warning and leave the missing values as None (or impute with 0, please specify preference - let's default to leaving them None and logging).\n",
    "o\tThe final result should be the original list of dictionaries, but with missing numerical values replaced by the calculated mean for their respective fields.\n",
    "3.\tControl Parameters and Debugging:\n",
    "o\tInclude a variable at the beginning of the script to define the API endpoint URL, making it easily modifiable: \n",
    "\tAPI_ENDPOINT_URL = \"https://api.spacexdata.com/v3/cores\" #(or /launches)\n",
    "o\tUse Python's standard logging module to provide informative output during execution. Configure logging to display messages at the INFO level.\n",
    "o\tLog key messages such as: starting data retrieval, number of records retrieved, starting imputation process, identified numerical fields potentially needing imputation (e.g., ['reuse_count', 'rtls_attempts', ...]), calculated mean for field X, number of missing values imputed for field X, any warnings for fields with no calculable mean, imputation complete, starting upload to httpbin, upload outcome.\n",
    "4.\tExecution Time Measurement:\n",
    "o\tCode Execution Time: Measure the time taken to perform the main operations (data retrieval + imputation). Print this time after the imputation operation is complete.\n",
    "o\tPipeline Execution Time: Measure the total execution time of the entire script (from the beginning until after the upload to httpbin). Print this total time at the end of the script. Use Python's time module.\n",
    "5.\tUpload Result:\n",
    "o\tTake the resulting imputed list of dictionaries from the imputation operation.\n",
    "o\tSerialize it into JSON format.\n",
    "o\tMake an HTTP POST request to the https://httpbin.org/post endpoint, sending the resulting imputed JSON data in the request body.\n",
    "o\tVerify the response from httpbin.org (e.g., check the status code) and log the outcome of the upload operation.\n"
