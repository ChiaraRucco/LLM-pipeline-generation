    "# SpaceX Data Pipeline - Python Script Specification\n",
    "\n",
    "You are an expert Python developer specializing in the **Databricks** environment.  \n",
    "Your task is to create a complete Python script to be executed within a **Databricks notebook**.  \n",
    "The script must perform the following operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Data Retrieval from SpaceX API\n",
    "\n",
    "- Interact with the SpaceX v3 REST API: [https://api.spacexdata.com/v3](https://api.spacexdata.com/v3).\n",
    "- Retrieve data from two specific endpoints:\n",
    "  - **All launches**: [https://api.spacexdata.com/v3/launches](https://api.spacexdata.com/v3/launches)\n",
    "  - **All rockets**: [https://api.spacexdata.com/v3/rockets](https://api.spacexdata.com/v3/rockets)\n",
    "- Handle potential errors during API calls:\n",
    "  - Timeouts\n",
    "  - Non-200 HTTP status codes\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Merge Operation\n",
    "\n",
    "- Perform a **merge (join)** between launches data and rockets data.\n",
    "- **Merge Logic**:\n",
    "  - For each launch record, add the **rocket's name** (`rocket_name`) from the rockets dataset.\n",
    "  - Match based on:\n",
    "    - `launch.rocket.rocket_id` ⟷ `rocket.rocket_id`\n",
    "- Final Output:\n",
    "  - A **list of dictionaries**, where each dictionary represents a launch enriched with its corresponding rocket name.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Control Parameters and Debugging\n",
    "\n",
    "- Define API endpoint URLs as variables at the beginning of the script for easy modification.\n",
    "- Use Python’s standard `logging` module:\n",
    "  - Configure logging to display messages at **INFO** level.\n",
    "  - Log key messages during execution:\n",
    "    - Starting data retrieval\n",
    "    - Number of launches retrieved\n",
    "    - Number of rockets retrieved\n",
    "    - Starting merge operation\n",
    "    - Number of records after merge\n",
    "    - Starting upload to `httpbin`\n",
    "    - Upload outcome\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Execution Time Measurement\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Code Execution Time**:\n",
    "  - Measure the time taken for **data retrieval + merge**.\n",
    "  - Print this time after completing the merge.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pipeline Execution Time**:\n",
    "  - Measure the **total execution time** (from start until after the upload).\n",
    "  - Print the total time at the end of the script.\n",
    "  - Use Python’s `time` module.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Upload Result\n",
    "\n",
    "- Serialize the resulting list into **JSON** format.\n",
    "- Make an HTTP **POST** request to [https://httpbin.org/post](https://httpbin.org/post), sending the JSON in the request body.\n",
    "- Verify and log the response:\n",
    "  - Check the HTTP status code\n",
    "  - Log the outcome of the upload operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n"
