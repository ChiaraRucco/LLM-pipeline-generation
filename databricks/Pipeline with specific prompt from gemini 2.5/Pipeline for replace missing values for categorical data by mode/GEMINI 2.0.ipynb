    "You are an expert Python developer specializing in the Databricks environment. Your task is to create a complete Python script to be executed within a Databricks notebook. The script must perform the following operations:\n",
    "1.\tData Retrieval from SpaceX API:\n",
    "o\tInteract with the SpaceX v3 REST API (https://api.spacexdata.com/v3).\n",
    "o\tRetrieve data from one specific endpoint likely containing categorical data where missing values might occur: \n",
    "\tAll Cores: https://api.spacexdata.com/v3/cores (Fields like status, block could be candidates)\n",
    "\tAlternative: All Launches: https://api.spacexdata.com/v3/launches (Fields like launch_site.site_name, rocket.rocket_name)\n",
    "o\tHandle potential errors during the API calls (e.g., timeouts, non-200 status codes).\n",
    "2.\tMissing Value Imputation (Mode):\n",
    "o\tPerform mode imputation on the retrieved data (list of dictionaries).\n",
    "o\tImputation Logic: \n",
    "\tIdentify Categorical Fields: First, automatically identify the keys/fields within the dictionaries that predominantly contain categorical data (e.g., strings - str). You might need to inspect the first few records or a sample, or iterate through checking types.\n",
    "\tCalculate Mode per Field: For each identified categorical field, determine the mode (the most frequent value) using only the existing, non-missing (not None) values across all records in the dataset. The collections.Counter class is suitable for this.\n",
    "\tHandle Ties: If multiple values share the highest frequency (a tie for the mode), select any one of them as the mode (e.g., the one that appears first alphabetically or the first one encountered during counting).\n",
    "\tImpute Missing Values: Iterate through the dataset again. For each categorical field, replace any missing values (represented as None) with the pre-calculated mode for that specific field.\n",
    "\tHandle Edge Cases: If a categorical field contains only missing values (or no non-missing values to calculate a mode), log a warning and leave the missing values as None.\n",
    "o\tThe final result should be the original list of dictionaries, but with missing categorical values replaced by the calculated mode for their respective fields.\n",
    "3.\tControl Parameters and Debugging:\n",
    "o\tInclude a variable at the beginning of the script to define the API endpoint URL, making it easily modifiable: \n",
    "\tAPI_ENDPOINT_URL = \"https://api.spacexdata.com/v3/cores\" #(or /launches)\n",
    "o\tUse Python's standard logging module to provide informative output during execution. Configure logging to display messages at the INFO level.\n",
    "o\tLog key messages such as: starting data retrieval, number of records retrieved, starting mode imputation process, identified categorical fields potentially needing imputation (e.g., ['status', 'block', ...]), calculated mode for field X, number of missing values imputed for field X, any warnings for fields with no calculable mode, mode imputation complete, starting upload to httpbin, upload outcome.\n",
    "4.\tExecution Time Measurement:\n",
    "o\tCode Execution Time: Measure the time taken to perform the main operations (data retrieval + mode imputation). Print this time after the imputation operation is complete.\n",
    "o\tPipeline Execution Time: Measure the total execution time of the entire script (from the beginning until after the upload to httpbin). Print this total time at the end of the script. Use Python's time module.\n",
    "5.\tUpload Result:\n",
    "o\tTake the resulting imputed list of dictionaries from the mode imputation operation.\n",
    "o\tSerialize it into JSON format.\n",
    "o\tMake an HTTP POST request to the https://httpbin.org/post endpoint, sending the resulting imputed JSON data in the request body.\n",
    "o\tVerify the response from httpbin.org (e.g., check the status code) and log the outcome of the upload operation.\n"
